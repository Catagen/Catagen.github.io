      <hr>
      <p>First off, we have the <r>seemingly</r> endless <r>research</r> of fuels. <r>Some pollute</r> our environment, but are <r>quick and easy</r> to use while others are <r>eco-friendly</r> but seem like such a <r>pain</r> for the <r>every-day purpose</r>. However, as research <r>progresses</r> we will almost <r>certainly</r> begin to power our engines with something <r>new</r> and better within the next decade. Right now, the two most <r>promising candidates</r> for substituting todays fuels are hydrogen and electricity.</p>
      <p>Of course as you all probably know, we <r>have had electric engines</r> that can power cars just as good as <r>gas or diesel fuel</r> for quite some time. The <r>problem</r> is that those cars are all part of the group that is kind of a <r>pain to use</r>. The problem <r>lies</r> not within the <r>engine</r> itself but the battery that powers it. Our batteries are simply too inefficient, and the loading process is too slow. Modern <r>society</r> moves in a <r>pace</r> that is higher than what our <r>batteries are capable of</r>, and the fact that the <r>most modern</r> electric cars take up to an <r>hour</r> to fully charge <r>discourages</r> many people from buying one. Hopefully, this will <r>change</r> in the near future. Maybe <r>graphene</r>, the <r>allotrope</r> that Fredrik and Jacob were talking about last week, is the <r>solution</r> to that problem.</p>
      <p>Moving on, we have <r>hydrogen</r>. Hydrogen would probably the <r>best</r> way to power a car <r>ever imaginable</r> - if we could get it to work. I <r>will not</r> go into detail on what hydrogen is, because you should all know that if you haven&#39;t been in some kind of hypersleep the past 10 years. The <r>problem</r> with hydrogen also lies within <r>containing</r> the fuel - but is very different. Hydrogen is <r>perfect</r> in the fact that after being burnt, it only <r>emits H2O</r>, in other words known as <r>water</r> which means zero pollution. But <r>beyond</r> that it is also extremely <r>explosive</r>, and that is where it gets <r>tricky</r>. How do you <r>store</r> an amount of hydrogen that <r>satisfies</r> a driver, without the <r>risk</r> of half a city <r>blowing up</r> when things go wrong?</p>
      <hr>
      <p>Many of you probably think that <r>antonymous</r> vehicles are just around the corner and will probably be <r>available</r> to the public in just a <r>few years</r>. Sadly, according to me and <r>most of the sources</r> that I&#39;ve read about this, it is <r>far from a reality</r>. The <r>complexity of algorithms</r> required to get fully automatic vehicles allowed to <r>drive on their own</r> by <r>governments</r> around the world is just too massive. I as a <r>programmer</r> like to think that I sort of understand how <r>complex such piece of software</r> has to be, and it is just mind-blowing. You can basically think of it as creating a <r>math algorithm</r> that acts the same way as a human brain would in <r>every possible road-related situation</r>. Give it a try, and make sure to contact proper authorities if you succeed, because you will be rich.</p>
      <p>The next decade will however be, and is starting to be, full of partly antonymous cars. We already have cars that can change lanes on highways and even keep a certain distance from the car in front. In the near future, cars will have access to even more sensors which means that in many situations the car will have the final say - not you. Cars will for example stop if you fail to apply the brakes or stop in certain situations even if the driver has the gas pedal floored.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>The <r>rapid increase</r> in <r>sensor technology</r> will also enable cars to actively <r>monitor our health</r>. Ford Motors has previewed the <r>idea of seatbelt or steering wheel sensors</r> track vital statistics. Combine that witch a <r>technology</r> that can wirelessly access your <r>mobile</r> phone and you have a car that can pull over and call for <r>medical help</r> when the driver has a heart attack.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>Lastly, our cars will probably end up full of <r>neat little features</r> that just make life easier - and cooler. I wouldn&#39;t be <r>surprised</r> if we soon could open our cars with our <r>fingerprints</r> just like our <r>iphones</r>, or if the <r>control panel</r> would be <r>replaced</r> with transparent glass displays.</p>
