      <hr>
      <p>First off, we have the seemingly endless research of fuels. Some pollute our environment, but are quick and easy to use while others are eco-friendly but seem like such a pain for the every-day purpose. However, as research progresses we will almost certainly begin to power our engines with something new and better within the next decade. Right now, the two most promising candidates for substituting todays fuels are hydrogen and electricity.</p>
      <p>Of course as you all probably know, we have had electric engines that can power cars just as good as gas or diesel fuel for quite some time. The problem is that those cars are all part of the group that is kind of a pain to use. The problem lies not within the engine itself but the battery that powers it. Our batteries are simply too inefficient, and the loading process is too slow. Modern society moves in a pace that is higher than what our batteries are capable of, and the fact that the most modern electric cars take up to an hour to fully charge discourages many people from buying one. Hopefully, this will change in the near future. Maybe graphene, the allotrope that Fredrik and Jacob were talking about last week, is the solution to that problem.</p>
      <p>Moving on, we have hydrogen. Hydrogen would probably the best way to power a car ever imaginable - if we could get it to work. I will not go into detail on what hydrogen is, because you should all know that if you haven&#39;t been in some kind of hypersleep the past 10 years. The problem with it also lies within containing the fuel - but is very different. Hydrogen is perfect in the fact that after being burnt, it only emits H2O, in other words known as water which means zero pollution. But beyond that it is also extremely explosive, and that is where it gets tricky. How do you store an amount of hydrogen that satisfies a driver, without the risk of half a city blowing up when things go wrong?</p>

      <p>Many of you probably think that antonymous vehicles are just around the corner and will probably be available to the public in just a few years. Sadly, according to me and most of the sources that I&#39;ve read about this, it is far from a reality. The complexity of algorithms required to get fully automatic vehicles allowed to drive on their own by governments around the world is just too massive. I as a programmer like to think that I sort of understand how complex such piece of software has to be, and it is just mind-blowing. You can basically think of it as creating a math algorithm that acts the same way as a human brain would in every possible road-related situation. Give it a try, and make sure to contact proper authorities if you succeed, because you will be rich.</p>
      <p>The next decade will however be, and is starting to be, full of partly antonymous cars. We already have cars that can change lanes on highways and even keep a certain distance from the car in front. In the near future, cars will have access to even more sensors which means that in many situations the car will have the final say - not you. Cars will for example stop if you fail to apply the brakes or stop in certain situations even if the driver has the gas pedal floored.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>The rapid increase in sensor technology will also enable cars to actively monitor our health. Ford Motors has previewed the idea of seatbelt or steering wheel sensors track vital statistics. Combine that witch a technology that can wirelessly access your mobile phone and you have a car that can pull over and call for medical help when the driver has a heart attack.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>Lastly, our cars will probably end up full of neat little features that just make life easier - and cooler. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if we soon could open our cars with our fingerprints just like our iphones, or if the control panel would be replaced with transparent glass displays.</p>
